URL-SHORTNER - convert url to alias:
FOR EXAMPLE, we have url https://github.com/tushkanchek/url-shortener and convert it to petProject1,
so now instead of writing this long url 
we can save it like 
<img width="841" height="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2efd-a8bb-45a6-a27a-58bd7099dd67" />
<img width="841" height="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/050be879-147e-4b03-a7ef-3b6c4ad13384" />

and then just open it like: 

<img width="662" height="71" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7009772f-6b8f-48de-93cd-3149cf91a63a" />


Also can delete added url by alias:
<img width="826" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c415030-824a-4b1c-b090-fe13ce9aa0fc" />

immediatly after deletion it will be not possible to access
